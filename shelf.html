                Organizing notes and photos on iPhone feels sterile compared to decorating our homes. Our walls hold memories and personality — yet digital spaces remain kind of cold.<br><br>
                In Shelf, your thoughts and most intimate ideas decorate the shelves. And by color-coding spaces or adding tunnels, you can create museums of ideas or deep labyrinths as complex and beautiful as you.

                    Inspired by the beauty and simplicity of shelves in our homes, Shelf feels familiar yet utterly unique. Its bold and brilliant color invites you to rethink, reshape, and reorganize.
                    This is thinking elevated to an art form—a place that is actually a part of creative conversation.

                <strong class="blue">You're an Art Curator</strong>
                <p>
                    Shelf's cabinet makes trying out new colors easy. And because it's built into every shelf, it can add items as fast as you think of them. 
                    If your shelves overflow, older items get safely tucked away in the cabinet. Think of yourself as an art curator. Some exhibitions only last so long. Others, well, they're due for a revival.

                    This case explores new approaches to organizing your digital artifacts.
                    I envisioned a space where users could easily store their notes, photos, voice memos, and more in a reliable, fun, and timeless place. One that encourages creative organization, beyond the constraints of traditional list views.

            <h2>A digital third place.</h2>
            <h6>
                “Third places" are communal spaces beyond home and work. Sociologist Ray Oldenburg coined this term for informal spots where we gather, chat, and simply enjoy each other's company. Cafes, parks, pubs — they let us to unwind and connect without demanding productivity.<br><br> 
                Today, software provides few of these spaces to mediate between work and private life. Shelf is an attempt to envision such a place — and really, it’s a place. You can get lost in your own mazes of thought by building elaborate tunnels or in a long session curating your next exhibition.

            <h2>Expand your collection.</h2>
            <h6>
                Tunnels help create organized labyrinths of self-expression, getting darker and more limited as you progress deeper into a space, encouraging more thoughtful use. Tunnels inspire introspection by drawing one inward both visually and metaphorically, created to make your innermost thoughts as easy to find as a Van Gogh in MoMA.<br><br> 
                Tunnel titles help you group main ideas. They're like their own rooms. The end result is an engaging way to take inventory of your evolving thoughts and feelings.

                    Started as a project into personal journaling, Shelf at its core is made for introspection. The time capsule artifact, for example, locks away items with time. This encourages one to leave notes for their future self—a reminder of how far they've come.

                    There is no limit to the amount of tunnels you can have in Shelf. You can even make a whole room of tunnels if you like. And in the odd chance that a space capable of holding 1,944 artifacts isn't enough, just create another space!

Or rip it up to delete it? What if when you put your ear to a voice memo, it starts to play? Welcome to spatial computing.

                    What if you could knock over a shelf and watch your stuff fall onto the ground? Maybe you could pick up an idea, a literal idea, and turn it over in your hands, and place it somewhere new, like tidying your room. Shelf's metaphor opens up exciting possibilities to connect with your thoughts in insanely natural ways. In Shelf, the future of emotional design is wide open.

                <p>
                    The desktop metaphor has dominated personal computing for 50 years. But if we looked instead to shelves, what would we find? I looked at as many shelves as I could, studying how and why people put things where they do. In many ways, I wanted a place that felt enormously personal yet limited, focused, and tactile. Today, we use computing metaphors mostly for productivity, but I think Shelf is what happens when we aim for something else.

                <p>
                    The project was born when a friend asked me to dream up a more aesthetic journaling app. I drew the app icon first and simply let the interface emerge out of it. A lot of features, like nesting, color changing, and note taking are already done quite well elsewhere. But Shelf feels more friendly and approachable than anything I've ever seen.
